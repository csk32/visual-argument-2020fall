Description of Project
For my project, the goal is to bring awareness to human trafficking; it will take the form of a call-to-action. I will be making the argument that we need to put an end to this epidemic. Talking about it can be uncomfortable, but as a result, a lot of people are unaware of the severity and are undereducated on the topic. I think an important aspect of getting the point across will be through statistics and numbers. Not only will the data shock the majority of people, but it will also attract them to the argument and make them want to learn more. I plan on adding a lot of different items that cost around $100 and then adding a person and writing, "What do all of these things have in common?". Then, I will go on to explain that the average cost of a slave in the global human trafficking market is $90.
